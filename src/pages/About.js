          <h3> Shmeeheart </h3>
          <p>
            Jennifer was born in a large family who reveled in nick-naming each
            other. No one knows how "Jennifer" warped into "Shmee" as a
            nickname, but it stuck throughout the years. Shmee can be spicy at
            times, but mainly she is a Shmeeheart ❤️
            <br></br>
            Jennifer has a natural curiosity for life and a desire to do and
            know everthing, which allows her to relish in many hobbies and
            explore various career paths. Technology is an area that has always
            sparked Jennifer's interest, but had not taken the steps to pursue
            education and experience further...until now. No matter what career,
            Jennifer believes that staying abreast of technological advances is
            imperative to success in the modern world. Her inquisitive nature
            has opened up the door to a new career in technology. The unknown is
            both exciting and terrifying and Jennifer welcomes the challenge.
            <br></br>
            Outside of work, you can find Jennifer rocking out at a concert, in
            the audience of a Broadway Musical, fishing, reading, listening to
            true crime podcasts, playing her guitar, bowling, gardening or
            singing!
